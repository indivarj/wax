This account draws from a range of sources, but especially Ratna Naidu's ***Old Cities, New Predicaments***.

Cities occupy an important place in the history of Indian Muslims. It is in cities that Muslim power emerged and consolidated itself from the medieval times through the colonial period. After independence, these urban centres became the sites where much conflict around religious identities also occurred periodically. Hyderabad is no exception. According to the 1951 census, the Muslims formed the majority community in the city, comprising 69% of the people. But in 1961, their population share dropped by 15 percentage points to 54%. This decline is the effect of the integration of the Hyderabad state with India (Naidu 1990). This integration led to out-migration of Muslims from all classes, especially the elite and the middle class, in search of safety. It also resulted in loss of employment for Muslims who were in the different levels of the Nizam’s administration. Change in the bureaucratic language from Urdu to Telugu led to further decline in job opportunities. During the years 1951-1971, there was a rise in Hindu population as well. The Hindu population took advantage of distress sale following integration, which resulted in the lowering of property prices, and they have invested in these properties (Naidu 1990).

However, from 1970s onwards, Muslims from the rural areas started migrating into the Old City of Hyderabad. These new populations began to settle down on the urban periphery. At the same time, both Muslim and Hindu households began moving out of the mixed areas and started moving into the neighborhoods which had the presence of significant numbers of their group in search of safety.  This segregation, therefore, is not a voluntary formation, but emerged because there was a push of migrants towards safe areas due to communal violence in search of safety. In Hyderabad, it is the erstwhile walled part of the city, which is now known as Old City, which has been the major site of violence and it is also increasingly becoming a homogenous space in religious terms. In the 1980s and 1990s, Hindus had fled away from Barkas, a locality of Chandrayangutta dominated by Muslims of Arab descent from Yemen. As a result, this earlier communally very sensitive area now does not witness the same kind of violence (Rao and Thaha 2012).

Three to four decades after the integration of Hyderabad in Indian state, the characteristic of the Old City has changed from one of being an important political and administrative site of Nizam rule and a space of mixed population, to being a classic case of ‘urban deprivation’ and more specifically of ‘multiple deprivation’. It also has the presence of Muslim dominated slums where artisans, semi-skilled or unskilled workers live. The present study illustrates the specific ways in which this trend still continues.
