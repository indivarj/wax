This Housing Atlas was created at [Hyderabad Urban Lab](https://hydlab.in) (HUL) primarily by [Harsha D.](https://harshadevulapalli.tumblr.com/) using data collected for RAY in 2011.

Most cities in the developing world such as Hyderabad, tend to have data in closed and archaic formats which impede interoperability. They also lack inventories to keep stock of multiple datasets across space and time (e.g. it is hard to find any data on pre-1990 municipal wards for Hyderabad). The periodic realignment of administrative boundaries and enumeration blocks makes it especially hard to build cohesive datasets over time. Uncertainty about data rights is another major problem. These issues often represent obstacles for anyone interested in doing research in these cities.

In a bid to transform Hyderabad into a “slum-free city” (real world-class city), the city government was to conduct a count of all the slums in its jurisdiction, which amounted to 1476. As is common, this task was outsourced to a private company. Unbelievably the task was to be conducted within 30 days and with a budget of just 1.8 million rupees (roughly 24000 Euros). In any case, some data was produced. Although there are some glaring inconsistencies, the map gives us the only representation of slums in Hyderabad, and more importantly, a representation of how the government itself sees the “slumscapes” of the city.

An atlas of maps depicting various characteristics of recognised slums in Hyderabad, was put together through a painstaking process of cleaning this inconsistent data. By sharing these maps with the government we wish to inform them about the possibilities for analysis and planning offered by clean spatial data. Through regular articles and interventions at consultation meetings, we are trying to push the government towards improving their data practices. This is a long-term project because we believe that apart from civic mapping projects, public data itself should be publicly accessible in general.

Being in the open domain, HUL's maps have constantly elicited new questions and new proposals from the citizens looking at them. It is evident that the general ethos to support the fruitful use of open data and the employment of practices of crowd-sourcing is already present in our city. With each new project, we try to tap into that ethos. With each workshop, we try to further encourage it. With each engagement, we try to extend the conviction that planning cities can be a more democratic exercise.
